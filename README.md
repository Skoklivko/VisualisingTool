# VisualisingTool

This visualising Tool uses React.js
In order to start go to the project folder and open command prompt and type npm start.
Wait for the project to load and go to http://localhost:3000/ in order use the tool.

The project is ongoing and it's not finished yet
For now the tool only shows merge sort.

Still TO DO:
Quick Sort
Heap Sort
Bubble sort
