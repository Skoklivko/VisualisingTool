This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## IDEA
The idea of this project is to create an app that has Merge Sort, Bubble sor, Heap sort and Quick sort algorithms that the user can play around with.

## HOW TO START 
go to the project folder and open command prompt 

1.type npm isntall in order to get all the node modules needed
2.type npm start in order to start the project then go to http://localhost:3000/ and enjoy

## NOT A FINISHED PROJECT  
For now the only working algorithm is Merge Sort.
